                </p><p style="text-align: justify">Leadership is the ability of an individual or a group of individuals to
                influence and guide followers or other members of an organization. </p>
            <p></p>

            <p>
                  Leadership involves making sound -- and sometimes difficult -- decisions, creating and articulating a clear vision, establishing
                  achievable goals and providing followers with the knowledge and tools necessary to achieve those goals.
            </p>

            <p>
                Leaders are found and required in most aspects of society, from business to politics to region to community-based organizations.
            </p>

            <p>
                An effective leader possess the following characteristics: self-confidence, strong communication and management skills, creative and innovative thinking,
                 perseverance in the face of failure, willingness to take risks, openness to change, and levelheadedness and reactiveness in times of crisis.
            </p>

            <p>
                In business, individuals who exhibit these leadership qualities can ascend to executive management or C-level positions, such as CEO, CIO or president.
                 Noteworthy individuals who have exhibited strong leadership in the technology industry include Apple founder Steve Jobs, Microsoft founder Bill Gates
                  and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.

                <br>



<span style="line-height: 1.5">Multiple definitions of leadership exist, although the different definitions generally converge in the theory that great leaders have the ability to make strategic<br>
and visionary decisions and convince others to follow those decisions.  The consensus is leaders create a vision and can successfully get others to work toward achieving that goal.<br>
They do this by setting direction and inspiring others to want to succeed in achieving the end result. Moreover, they are capable of getting people excited and motivated to work toward the vision.</span><br>

In other words, great leaders know how to both inspire people and get followers to complete the tasks that achieve the leader's goal.<br>

Former U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower articulated this idea when he said, "Leadership is the art of getting someone else to do something you want done because he wants to do it."</span></p>
